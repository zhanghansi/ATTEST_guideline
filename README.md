<!-- ABOUT THE GUIDELINE -->
## About The Guideline

ATTEST (vAriable selecTion and daTa sourcE Selection and inTegration) is a reporting guideline for reporting the the variable selection and data source selection and integration process.  We provided an ATTEST check list to help researchers to annotate and clearly document each step of their mIDA studies to ensure the transparency and reproducibility.
